Make a program that reads three floating point values: A, B and C. Then, calculate and show:
a) the area of the rectangled triangle that has base A and height C.
b) the area of the radius's circle C. (pi = 3.14159)
c) the area of the trapezium which has A and B by base, and C by height.
d) the area of the square that has side B.
e) the area of the rectangle that has sides A and B.
